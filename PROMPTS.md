add a tiny button to the chatbot response messages that are then saved and displayed on the saved.html page
can you show me where to add the button in chat.js
when i save a message, can you switch from save-icon to saved-icon
Switch the save-icon to the already existing saved-icon.png when clicked
When I return to the chat bot page, how can I save the previous conversation? I don't want it to refresh
